Emotion intensity of Tweets using Machine Learning

Codalab username : nagasai3810

I've tried to submit my model's result for evalution in codalab but the submissions are disabled.
I created individual model for each emotion as per the requirement in the task page. 
We can also train a single model with all 4 emotions and then we can predict the emotion intensity.
The static model is having around ~68% of pearson and spearman correlation.
The deep learning model is having ~85% of pearson and spearman correlation.


To run the code open in jupyter notebook and click run all.
All libraries are mention in the code itself with installations, no need to download any external libraries
Simply we can run in jupyter notebook or google colab

In order to run in colab we need to upload the training dataset to the runtime.
