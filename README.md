Emotion intensity of Tweets using Machine Learning

Codalab username : nagasai3810

I've tried to submit my model's result for evalution in codalab but the submissions are disabled.
I created individual model for each emotion as per the requirement in the task page. 
We can also train a single model with all 4 emotions and then we can predict the emotion intensity.
The static model is having around ~68% of pearson and spearman correlation.
The deep learning model is having ~85% of pearson and spearman correlation.
